This is the place where you will find the captures of my honeypot, finally stable and full-automated. (don't say it too loud)
It's a little project I had in mind for long time and finally I had the time to run it: I really like the idea of having my own
"fresh malware bazaar to reverse in my cave", that is the main goal of having this honeypot running.
Also, you'll find in "bistreams" folder all the traffic generated per port, which I expected less interesting than having 
dropped binaries. I was wrong.

The core engine is dionaea (https://github.com/DinoTools/dionaea), a great project!

I don't know how long I will keep it pushing here on github but in the meanwhile .. enjoy it!
